    <p>We beagan with the freecodecamp software where we followed a series of curriculum activities in the software. They included the the responsive web design course which took us through a basic headstart to building a cat photo application website using these tags.
        We encountered a lot of adverse ways to build a robust website using links, photos and text.
        A lot of problems were also encountered on the freecodecamp journey.
        Errors being made in the website preparation were spotted by the software.
